We select _Bluebikes_, previously known as _Hubway_, in Metro Boston as our case study for this paper and use a quasi-experimental framework to model the impact of a new bikeshare station on reducing auto-dependence in its environs.

**Hypothesis 1** Overall effect

Bikesharing can have a positive effect on auto-dependence reduction.

**Hypothesis 2** Proximity to transit effect

Bikeshare stations located near mass transit stations are likely to have a stronger impact on reducing auto-dependence.

**Hypothesis 3** Lagged effect

The positive impact of bikesharing on reducing auto-dependence can be lagged over time.

Since it was one of the first metro areas to embrace bikesharing at the turn of the last decade, this study evaluates the extent to which bikesharing has been successful in reducing auto-dependence.
