Frequently Asked Questions

What are the main types of external memory discussed?

  

The main types include magnetic disks, RAID systems, optical storage (such as CD-ROMs and DVDs), and magnetic tape.

  

How does RAID enhance data storage?

  

RAID enhances data storage through redundancy and performance improvements, allowing data to be spread across multiple disks for better speed and reliability.

  

What are the advantages and disadvantages of optical storage?

  

Optical storage is advantageous for its large capacity and ease of mass production but is typically slower and may be read-only in certain formats.

  

What is the difference between fixed and movable head disks?

  

Fixed head disks have a stationary read/write head for each track, while movable head disks utilize a single head that moves to access different tracks, impacting data access speed and reliability.
