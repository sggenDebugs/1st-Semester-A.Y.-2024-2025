Failure to understand tension between life-giving and hostile religion
- caused damage done by millions of people
- caused people to reject religion altogether

If God was a tyrant who favor only the rich, two options were seen:
- hold on to the hope that a reformation will come
- cut ties with God

**Some kinds of atheism a can be key components in finding the true God or the Heart of Christianity**

**Understandings of Atheism reflects the fundamental struggle at the heart of Christianity between false gods and the true God**

This book tries to differentiate the influence of Jesus on how people envisioned God (then and now) with the religion of Caesar with the traditionalist approach to maintain political and social state of affairs

Romans accused the early Christians of atheism not because they do not believe in a god, but because their God does not match like the appearance of Caesar and the other Roman Gods. The 
Christian God for Romans must have thought that it does not look and feel dominant and it was not backed up by old traditions.

Early Christians even felt complimented when the Romans charged them as atheists
- a false god is no god at all
