Failure to understand tension between life-giving and hostile religion
- caused damage done by millions of people
- caused people to reject religion altogether

If God was a tyrant who favor only the rich, two options were seen:
- hold on to the hope that a reformation will come
- cut ties with God

**Some kinds of atheism a can be key components in finding the true God or the Heart of Christianity**

**Understandings of Atheism reflects the fundamental struggle at the heart of Christianity between false gods and the true God**

This book tries to differentiate the influence of Jesus on how people envisioned God (then and now) with the religion of Caesar with the traditionalist approach to maintain political and social state of affairs

Romans accused the early Christians of atheism not because they do not believe in the Roman gods, but because their God does not match like the appearance and attributes of mighty Roman emperors and the other Roman Gods. The Christian God for Romans must have thought that it does not look and feel dominant and it was not backed up by old traditions. Even Christianity in the later ages when it is the most dominant religion in the world is not excused of this as well. During the Spanish Colonization in the Philippines, Spanish religious folks disapproved and abolished ancient folk religions that were in the Philippines since it does not match with the attributes and likeliness of God and they were not backed by old traditions. This point changed my perspective on how the Romans treated the early Christians before and how different groups of people treated each other differently until now.

Early Christians even felt complimented when the Romans charged them as atheists
