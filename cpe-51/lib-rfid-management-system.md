- Relies on RFID for data management and books security
- Uses Raspberry Pi/Arduino Uno to process signals from RFID
- RFID Module: RFID-RC522
- RFID Stickers can be planted in each book.
- RFID reader can scan multiple tags at once and can update to a connected database

#### pros
- **very convenient to manage books** - the reader can read multiple books at once and combined with a minicomputer (raspberry pi or arduino), it is easier to update the status of each book.
- **high data security** - each rfid tag is encrypted that ensures no data breaching. plus, system can detect and alarm administrator if a book is missing once its rfid reader detects a status change of a book
- very minimal to setup
- peel-and-paste rfid tag
