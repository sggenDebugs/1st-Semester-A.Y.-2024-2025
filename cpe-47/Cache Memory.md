Multiple layers of memory between processor and main memory
![[cachemem.drawio.png]]

- smaller and faster than main memory
- used to speed up memory access by storing data in it temporarily for usage in the future
- greater performance = more levels of cache
- L1 closest to processor
- L2, L3, ... so on
