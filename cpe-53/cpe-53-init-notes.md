Fundamental of Signals

  - What is a Signal
    - quantitative description of physical phenomenon, event or process
    - examples:
      - electrical current
      - PSEI
      - Audio Signal
      - Image
  
  - Two Types of Signals
    - Continuous-Time Signal - Signals where there's always a value in a continuous time
    - Discrete-Time Signal - Equally Sampled Signals at a discrete time

    - when measuring the height of the value in the discrete-time signal, it is better to use a bigger resolution
      - discrete values don't use decimals

  - Review of Complex Numbers
    - z (complex number) = x + jy, where x and y are *Real Numbers* Real Numbers and j is imaginary
    - i or j = square root of -1
    - change rectangular form to polar form to exponential form and vice versa
    - Euler's Formula
  - Basic Operations of Signals
    - Time Shift
      - When shifting signal to the right, amount of steps will be negative.
      - When to the left, steps is positive.
    - Time Reversal
      - Signal is reversed with respect to the reference of origin
    - Time Scaling
      - t is multiplied by constant a
        - a > 1 , decimated
        - a < 1 , slowed down

Periodicity
  - Periodic
    - value of the signal repeats over a period of time 

  - Aperiodic
    - Pattern of the signal changes over time.
    - patern is not fixed
