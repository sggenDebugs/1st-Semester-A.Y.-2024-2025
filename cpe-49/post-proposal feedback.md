The proposal brought a lot of feedback and feature improvements from Sir. He sticked to the idea of a built-in search engine in the OLIS that:
- not only does basic searching but can do keyword searching that matches out similar documents.
- can perform logic search (AND, OR)
- software only designed for cataloging research papers.

Suggestion: look for patents/projects of search engines via
- PATENTSCOPE: https://patentscope.wipo.int/
- Github
- background and specification check on google search engine

Also, there's a need to change organizational chart due to lack of backend manpower.
